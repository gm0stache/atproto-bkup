# atproto-ipfs-bkup

Util for backing up ATproto repos to IPFS.

## concept

the tool should enable people to simply backup their repo to IPFS.
the advanced functionality should be that the tool unwraps the '.car' repo export into something that IPFS natively understands.

todo: - what should be the value of being able to directly address cid's from bsky in IPFS? pull your whole graph from bsky - why?
